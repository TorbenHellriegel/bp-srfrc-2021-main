Disclaimer: The original and complete project is in a private git repository. This git repository contains only a small part of the full project, namely the Speech PSD Estimator and the Wiener Filter, which cannot function on their own. This is only meant as a code example. All code was written in equal parts by Erik Bramman and me.
