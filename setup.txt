Create folder "resources" if it doesn't exist.

Download "Speech Commands Dataset v0.02" and extract them.
Move the extracted folder to the "resources" folder and rename "Speech Commands Dataset v0.02" to "Default".

If you want to add templates for specific users, add a folder with the name of the person, e.g. "Felix" inside "resources".
Inside of this folder, there has to be the same folder structure as inside of the "Default" folder.
You also need a "testing_list.txt" inside of the new "Felix" folder.
"save_recording.py" may sometimes help you, depending on how your data is structured.
Example:

resources
|- Default
  |- down
    |- 00b01445_nohash_0.wav
    |- 00b01445_nohash_1.wav
    ...
  |- up
    |- 00b01445_nohash_0.wav
    |- 00b01445_nohash_1.wav
    ...
  ...
  |- testing_list.txt
|- Felix
  |- down
    |- felix00_nohash_0.wav
    |- felix00_nohash_1.wav
  |- up
    |- felix01_nohash_0.wav
    |- felix01_nohash_1.wav
  ...
  |- testing_list.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------------
There should allready be a "testing_list.txt" inside of the Default folder. You also need to create a similar file if you have a specific user.
"save_recording.py" can help you, if your folders are allready structured correctly.
Example testing_list.txt inside felix folder:

down/felix00_nohash_0.wav
down/felix00_nohash_1.wav
eight/felix01_nohash_0.wav
eight/felix01_nohash_1.wav
five/felix02_nohash_0.wav
five/felix02_nohash_1.wav
four/felix03_nohash_0.wav
four/felix03_nohash_1.wav
